Things to know about each Amenity:
- Max Capacity

Things to know about each Day:
-Day of the week
-Calendar Day
-Timeslots


Things to know about each timeslot:
- Start and end time
- Current Capacity
- Max capacity (same as amenity)





Steps
1. Load the reservations that the current user has into the pages javascript for cross-checking which timeslots the user has already reserved and updating their class names to match
    a. Turn the reservations the user has for the amenity into dictionary then json in the view
    b. Pass the json to the template globally for the js interaction
    c. Pass the amenity timeslot json to the template

2. Script 1 - Availabiltity Loading Script: Make a script to generate availability cards from the amenity timeslot data and all the timeslots within
    a. Generate availability cards
    b. When looping to generate the timeslots, if the current user has a corresponding reservation already

3. Script 2 - Make script to allow the user to select the timeslots
    a. When a user selects the timeslot, append the timeslot card away from the availabilty card and into the panel called "selected" on the right

4. Form submission: On saving the selected reservations, if the timeslots submitted are under the timeslot capacity, then create a reservation for each timeslot selected.
    a. If the timeslot is at capacity, don't make a reservation and produce an error.
    b. 

5. Celery Tasks: 
    Every new week, update the date of the timeslot days with the next dates for the week ahead

On timeslot click, if it is selectable
